This directory contains the source to dynadraw3, a program
which draws calligraphic strokes by filtering mouse movements.
Holding the primary mouse button down while dragging the
mouse produces a stroke.  Clicking the secondary mouse
button clears the window.  Dynadraw3 adds printing to dynadraw2.

There are two printing modes: Scale-To-Page or Full Size.  
Scale-To-Page is the default.  The scale factor is determined
by calculating the horizontal scale and the vertical scale, and
the taking the smaller of the two and applying it to the FilterView
with BView::SetScale().

Full Page mode determines how many pages the drawing takes up
in the horizontal and vertical directions, and then offseting
the current page rectangle to the top of each page, and calling
FilterView::Draw().
