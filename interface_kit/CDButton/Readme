Enclosed CDButton sample code is a fully functional CD player controller.
It is implemented as a replicant, also it may be installed into the Deskbar.
The code illustrates the following BeOS programming techinques:

	- How to write a replicant
	- How to place a replicant into the Deskbar
	- How to control a CD player
	- How to implement some exotic controls

In addtion to that it uses the following interresting techinques:

	- Using an Observe-Notify mechanism for synchronization
	- Using function objects with BMessages
	
A makefile and CodeWarrior project files for both PPC and Intel platforms are
provided.

Notes:

To use the CDButton in the Deskbar type the following in your Terminal:

CDButton -deskbar

You can have CDButton show up in your Deskbar each time you start BeOS by
including a line like that in UserStartup. You should either move CDButton
to ~/config/bin or even better create a symbolic link to it from your
project folder. That way you can hack away at it and have the latest get
installed each time. Note that as with any replicant based binary, you need
to make sure that CDButton is properly mimeset and if you have multiple copies
that it is the preferred one (you can do this either by calling mimeset -f
on the appropriate binary or by selecting it in the Tracker and using
Identify). Also, if you make any changes to the binary, they will not get
propagated to all the active replicant instances until you quit/restart the
replicant shelf application.
