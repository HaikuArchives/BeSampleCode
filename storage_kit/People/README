People -- README

This directory contains the source code for building
the standard People application that ships with BeOS.
You can use this application to create Person records,
which can be dropped into BeMail headers (see the
BeOS User's Guide Chap. 4: Sending Mail) and other
applications.

Ostensibly, this application reveals how the Person
record is stored, but it also demonstrates how to
use the BeOS file type database in an application.
