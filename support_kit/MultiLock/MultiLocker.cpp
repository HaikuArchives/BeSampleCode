/* this function demonstrates a nice method of determining if the current thread */
/* is the writer or not.  The method involves caching the index of the page in memory */
/* where the thread's stack is located.  Each time a new writer acquires the lock, */
/* its thread_id and stack_page are recorded.  IsWriteLocked gets the stack_page of the */
/* current thread and sees if it is a match.  If the stack_page matches you are guaranteed */
/* to have the matching thread.  If the stack page doesn't match the more traditional  */
/* find_thread(NULL) method of matching the thread_ids is used. */

/* This technique is very useful when dealing with a lock that is acquired in a nested fashion. */
/* It could be expanded to cache the information of the last thread in the lock, and then if the */
/* same thread returns while there is no one in the lock, it could save some time, if the same thread */
/* is likely to acquire the lock again and again. */
/* I should note another shortcut that could be implemented here */
/* If fWriterThread is set to -1 then there is no writer in the lock, and we could */
/* return from this function much faster.  However the function is currently set up */
/* so all of the stack_base and thread_id info is determined here.  WriteLock passes */
/* in some variables so that if the lock is not held it does not have to get the thread_id */
/* and stack base again.  Instead this function returns that information.  So this shortcut */
/* would only move this information gathering outiside of this function, and I like it all */
/* contained. */
