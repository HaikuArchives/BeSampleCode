This directory contains several sample programs
that use the BMediaFile and BMediaTrack API's.

The programs are:

	• easy - a simple example showing how to 
			  process all the video and audio frames
			  in a media file.

	• mplay - a very simple media player program

	• transcode - a command line program that will
				     convert from one file format to another.
