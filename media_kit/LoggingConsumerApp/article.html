<P> 
<P>As anyone who sat through the Node Track of the recent Be 
Developers Conference can attest, writing Media Kit nodes 
is a complex task. Be's engineering team has been hard at 
work extending the Media Kit APIs to simplify node 
construction; similarly, DTS has been developing tools 
developers can use to debug their own BMediaNodes. This 
week's article introduces a tool for analyzing the behavior 
of any BBufferProducer node or node chain: the 
LoggingConsumer. Designed to work with the Genki/6 beta 
release (I told you the APIs were under construction!), 
this node tracks the behavior of its input stream, logging 
a trace of all activity to a file for post-mortem analysis. 


<P>Before I discuss what exactly the LoggingConsumer does, 
here's the URL to download it, so that you can follow along 
at home:

</a>&gt; 


<P> 
<b>So, What Is This &quot;LoggingConsumer&quot; Anyway?</b> 


<P>As BBufferConsumers go, LoggingConsumer is pretty simple: it 
doesn't manipulate its input buffers in any way, it doesn't 
talk to hardware, and it doesn't pass buffers downstream -- 
it sits at the end of the node chain. It has a single input, 
which can accept any kind of data. You, the developer, connect 
to a node or node chain that you're interested in, point it at 
an output file entry ref, and voila! Useful information about 
buffer flow and internode handshaking is recorded for later 
interpretation. 


<P>The LoggingConsumer node serves two purposes: it produces a 
trace of node activity, for the purpose of debugging 
producers and producer/filter node chains; and it serves as 
a clean example of BBufferConsumer structure and behavior. 
The node tries to do everything &quot;right,&quot; and is commented to 
help you understand what's going on at all points in the 
code. The node uses the latest and greatest 
BMediaEventLooper class. It publishes a set of controllable 
parameters via a BParameterWeb, and handles the 
B_MEDIA_PARAMETERS buffer type for changing those 
parameters. It reports late buffers to the producer, and 
reports latency changes as well. In short, it demonstrates 
pretty much all of the major functionality that a 
BBufferConsumer has to worry about. 


<P> 
<b>So, How's It Work?</b> 


<P>In order to preserve the realtime behavior of a proper Media 
Kit node, the LoggingConsumer doesn't do any disk access 
from within its main BMediaNode control thread. Instead, it 
spawns a separate thread to write logged messages to disk, 
and passes messages to that thread via a kernel port. The 
LogWriter class encapsulates this pattern, managing the 
non-realtime thread and message port transparently to the 
LoggingConsumer node implementation. 


<P>The LoggingConsumer itself is another example of using the 
new BMediaEventLooper class to handle most of the 
nitty-gritty details of being a node. Because it does very 
little actual media-related processing, it's a pretty clear 
illustration of the organization we recommend that nodes 
use. The example application, which hooks the 
LoggingConsumer up to an audio file reader, also uses a 
simple &quot;Connection&quot; structure to illustrate the necessary 
bookkeeping for setting up and tearing down the connection 
between two nodes. 


<P> 
<b>What's It Give Me?</b> 


<P>Lots. Every virtual entry point a media node has generates 
an entry in the log file (with the minor exception of 
GetNextInput() and DisposeInputCookie() -- and you can add 
support for these easily). Log entries are marked with the 
current real time (i.e., system_time()) when they are 
generated, as well as the current time according to the 
LoggingConsumer's time source. Some operations log 
additional information, as well. For example, when a buffer 
is received, the logged message will indicate whether it is 
already late. When a buffer is handled (i.e., popped off of 
the BMediaEventLooper's event queue) the buffer's 
performance time is logged, as well as how early the buffer 
was handled. That &quot;offset&quot; needs to lie within the node's 
scheduling latency; if it doesn't, the buffer is late. The 
node also maintains a count of late buffers, so your testing 
application can follow what's happening. 


<P>LoggingConsumer is a BControllable, too, and you can 
manipulate certain aspects of its behavior while it's 
running. In particular, you can adjust its latency on the 
fly. Reacting to latency changes is one of the trickier 
aspects of BBufferProducer nodes, so having this facility in 
the buffer consumer lets you test a producer in a reliable, 
repeatable fashion. Future versions of the LoggingConsumer 
will have other controllable features as well, such as the 
ability to change media formats on the fly.


<P>Here's an example of what you get in the log file: 

<blockquote><pre> 
LOG_REGISTERED           : realtime = 240371553910, perftime = 262890

LOG_PREROLL              : realtime = 240371565650, perftime = 2331466400 
LOG_START                : realtime = 240372603671, perftime = 2332503192

        status = 2 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372604448, perftime = 2332503969 
        start = 2332553303, offset = -5666 
        Buffer received *LATE* 
LOG_BUFFER_HANDLED       : realtime = 240372604481,  perftime = 2332504002 
        start = 2332553303, offset = -701 
        Buffer handled *LATE* 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372604687, perftime = 2332504209 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372605766, perftime = 2332505279 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372606497, perftime = 2332506016 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372607226, perftime = 2332506744 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372608545, perftime = 2332508060 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372624297, perftime = 2332523788 
LOG_BUFFER_HANDLED       : realtime = 240372638948, perftime = 2332538420 
        start = 2332593303, offset = 4876 
LOG_BUFFER_RECEIVED      : realtime = 240372678548, perftime = 2332577979 
LOG_BUFFER_HANDLED       : realtime = 240372678965, perftime = 2332578395 
        start = 2332633303, offset = 4906 
</pre></blockquote> 

<P>The &quot;realtime&quot; field is the current system time() at the 
moment the message was logged, and &quot;perftime&quot; is the 
LoggingConsumer's idea of the current time according to its 
time source (i.e., the current performance time). As you can 
see, the node is registered, then the format negotiation 
with the producer occurs, the node is Preroll()ed, then it's 
Start()ed. When the producer node was started it sent a 
ProducerDataStatus() message, then began sending buffers. 
Note that there is a distinction between the buffer's 
receipt in BufferReceived() and its eventual handling in 
HandleEvent(). Also note that given our stated scheduling 
latency of 5000 microseconds, the first buffer was sent too 
late for the LoggingConsumer to handle in a timely manner -- 
information to be communicated to whoever wrote this 
particular BBufferProducer node! 


<P>The LogWriter class can easily be adapted to log other sorts 
of messages. Just add your own custom message codes to the 
log_what enum in LogWriter.h, string translations for them 
to the log_what_to_string() function, and appropriate 
handling in LogWriter::HandleMessage(). If you need to pass 
custom information in the log message, add a new variant to 
the union declared in the log_message struct. 


<P>If you're developing BBufferProducer nodes, this class will 
help you debug them. If you're developing BBufferConsumers, 
this node will show you how to structure your code. And if 
you're just writing Media Kit applications, this node gives 
you an easy way to tell whether you've set up the rest of 
the node chain correctly. Any way you slice it, 
LoggingConsumer is a must-have component in any Media Kit 
development suite!
