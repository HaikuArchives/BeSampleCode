This project is an input_server add-on.  To use it
you must install it into: 

   /boot/home/config/add-ons/input_server/devices

and then restart the input_server by typing:

	/system/servers/input_server -q 

in a Terminal window.  When you get tired of
it you'll have to reinstall the BeOS from cd.  Hah.
Just kidding.  You just have to delete the file
from /boot/home/config/add-ons/input_server/devices
and restart the input server again.
