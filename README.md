# BeOSSampleCode

This repository holds the original BeOS developer sample code for those interested in learning the BeOS / Haiku APIs. It also has a branch of the original archive (`master`) and a port to Haiku (in the `haiku` branch).

Although some projects in the sample code compiles on Haiku with small changes, there are still some which use the old BeOS APIs which need to updated to use the Haiku API.
