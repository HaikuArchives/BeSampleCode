Whack 2.0
by Ficus Kirkpatrick
--------------------

NOTE: Whack only works when your screen is in 16-bit mode.

If you're reading this because you can't compile expressions,
you are probably running Whack from the obj.(ppc/x86) directory.
It depends on being run from the same directory as the template
file, so copy it up a level.

One annoying "feature" of Whack is that you have to save your
expressions before you can add them to the Favorites list.
Sorry.  That was pure laziness on my part.

Here are the variables you can use in your expressions:

x	The screen-relative X coordinate of the current pixel
y	The screen-relative Y coordinate of the current pixel
ix	The window-relative X coordinate of the current pixel
iy	The window-relative X coordinate of the current pixel
f	A number that is incremented once per frame
t	Time (actually, a number that is incremented once per pixel)

Some of my cool ones:

x+y+f
((x+y)^0^x+y+f)
(x^y)+f
(((x+y)^0^x)+f)
(((x+f)^y)+(ix^(iy+f))+f)
(x+f)+ix+(x^(y+f))+f
x+y+int(sin(x)*f)<<16

Some of Dominic's cool ones:

(((x*f/10)<<16)|((x/(f+1)/10)&0xff)<<8)|((y*f/10)&0xff)
(((f*(t%10000)*ix)&0xff)<<16)|(((x*(f%100)*iy)&0xff)<<8)|((t*f)&0xff)
(((f*(t%10000)*ix)&0xff)<<16)|(((x*(f%800)/iy)&0xff)<<8)|((t*f)&0xff)
(((x*(f%800)/iy)&0xff)<<8)|((t*f)&0xff)
x+x+f|(y+y+f)<<8|(x+y+f)<<16

Benoit's that gave me the idea:

(x+y)*(x-y)+(f*5)
